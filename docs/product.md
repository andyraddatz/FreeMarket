# FreeMarket - market tools for free stuff

FreeMarket is the simplest way to get rid of free stuff.

## The Problem - Getting rid of free things is not easy enough

People have things of value that they no longer need.  Selling these things would require some implied or negotiated testament of quality or functionality, opening up recourse by a buyer if these expectations were not met on delivery.  The money that could be made by selling these things is not worth the effort for the offeror.  The offeror is willing to give these things away for free to avoid this negotiation process and to forego any implied warranty.

After deciding to give things away for free, the offeror must choose whether to bring everything to a donation center (Goodwill, Salvation Army, etc) or to list the items to some online platform for pickup. It is clear that the latter option is being chosen more and more because several communities have arisen on different platforms based around listing and exchanging free things. 

This poses a wide variety of problems for the offeror to deal with:

- There is no single platform dedicated to this process
  - Choosing a platform requires locating the group/forum/market that gives a sufficient likelihood of someone requesting their items
  - Technical overhead: Offerors must pinpoint exactly where and how to create a listing within the platform
    - Pictures must be taken and descriptions must be written
  - Privacy compromises: Offerors may need to create an account and give more info than necessary to give away free things because of the platform requirements
- Dealing with requestors
  - There are often many different offers made very soon after posting
    - The offeror must decide on some mechanism to decide who gets the things, and must inform the entire group of requestors who "won"
    - If the "winner" does not follow through, the offeror must choose whether to inform the previous requestors and confirm who is still interested and pick another "winner" 
  - If an offeror is attempting to get rid of several things at once, often the offeror will need to deal with multiple sets of requestors asking for different items and coordinate pick-up times and locations for each
  - There are no built-in reputation systems, so unless the offeror recognizes the requestor, there is no basis of determining who will follow through and pick up your item
  - Time and location appointments must be set and kept for planned pickups
    - Privacy compromise: This often involves giving out a home address to relative strangers for convenience
